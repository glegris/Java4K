The arrogance of wizards. They're all half mad if you ask me. Now they're squabbling again. No one knows why and I doubt they remember. Once again they're leaving a trail of scorched ruins and charred corpses as they try to kill each other.

Objective

Take all four castles by killing the defenders and entering the keep.
