Welcome to "Space Devastation!"
You are the lucky owner of a heavily armed spaceship. During a tuning exhibition, someone use his keys to scratch the paint! When you realize the fact, the criminal is already gone. In an attempt to catch his flying wreck, you accidentally hit an asteroid! The world is against you, what do I say the universe!

So you decide to take revenge of the universe by destroying it!

Unfortunately, the legions of Captain Galaxy are not going to let you do! Will that be enough to stop you? Your ship has been damaged in the collision (but vengeance cannot wait!) Your repairs bots has begun to do their work. Your spaceship will not be fully operational from the beginning, but it would be soon!

The Secret tips of General Forthx:

Your shield and your ultralaser both use energy. This energy slowly recharges but if it drop below 25% ultralaser is disabled for your own security.
Enemies do not use a shield. If they are damaged they lose attack power.
The shootings of most dangerous enemies are brighter than others.
Your secondary fire (ultralaser) is expensive but devastating! Do not forget it!
Each level you gain energy bonus and each two levels you gain a special bonus due to the reparations. This bonus can change your way to play !

The game has 10 levels and 3 modes:

The first mode is good for learning to play and for CASUAL gamers. For other it could be quickly boring. The game is slow and it is possible to complete it without the ultralaser.

The second mode is for AVERAGE gamers who want some challenge. In this mode you must learn to use your ultralaser to reach level 10, even if the game starts smoothly.

The third mode is for trained player who wants adrenalin and scoring. You have more speed, more enemies, more bullets and obviously more fun!
