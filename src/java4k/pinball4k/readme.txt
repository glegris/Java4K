Strategy

Hit anything that is blinking. Bonuses are shown by an object blinking. So if it is blinking, try to hit it.

Go for the multiplier. Learn how to trap the ball on the left flipper. If you trap it on the right flipper you can tilt the board to move it to the left. Then hit the right lane to move the ball to the multiplier dropdown. Use tilt to complete the rollover on the right.

Use the slingshots to hit the kickers and bumper rollovers. Use tilt to get extra kick from the slingshots.

Use the tilt as much as possible to conroll the ball. But be careful, the board is locked if you tilt two times in under half a second.
